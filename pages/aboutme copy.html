Hi! I'm Nullify!</p><p><br>
I am an Free and Open Source C and C# Software Developer as well as an IT Enthusiast in the hardware
sphere and not just software.
<br>I Also produce music from scratch as well as design my own synth sounds from just one raw sound wave!
<br>My great interest in software enables me to learn and improve exponentially and understand new concepts
pretty quickly.</p><p><br>
I observed a few things when it comes to the world of IT:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Better hardware encourages worse code, and worse code encourages better hardware<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Standards are great in code. Just know when to make exceptions when a more beneficial thing comes up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We tend to overcomplicate things when we could just simplify and keep everything to a minimum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If an alternative method is available, see if its better than the current.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
<br><br>I have been using Linux since 2017 and have tried Ubuntu and Arch Linux systems.
			</p>
			<p>
<br>My Motto?<br>"Nothing more, nothing less - Keep it simple, cut the excess"
