<b>Hi! I'm Nullify!</b>

I am an Free and Open Source C and C# Software Developer as well as an IT Enthusiast in the hardware sphere
and not just software. <br>I Also produce music from scratch as well as design my own synth sounds from just
one raw sound wave! <br>My great interest in software enables me to learn and improve exponentially and
understand new concepts pretty quickly.

I observed a few things about the world of IT:
- Better hardware encourages worse code, and worse code encourages better hardware
- Standards are great in code. Just know when to make exceptions when a more beneficial thing comes up
- We tend to overcomplicate things when we could just simplify and keep everything to a minimum

I use Linux since 2017 and main Ubuntu and tried Arch Linux systems.

<b>My Motto?</b>
"Nothing more, nothing less - Keep it simple, cut the excess"
